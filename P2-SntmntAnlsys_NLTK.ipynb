The world being controlled by three super-powers that (if you read to Goldstein's book) would supposedly,and I agree,would gain absolutly nothing from all this. The are simply trying to use excess junk. Anyways,Orwell did an amazing job on this book,creating several radically new ideas for the time,including creating Newspeak,\"Big Brother (which was the basis for the show \"\"\"\"Big Brother\"\"\"\")\",and,the worst,Thoughtcrime. Anyways,this is DEFINATELY not a childs book,so you should keep it out of the hands of anyone ignorant to the world. It makes you think of the present,\"and the future.

       "neg\\t\"1984 is a classic that doesn't deserve to be.: While regarded as a \"\"classic\"\" by some literary scholars,1984 is devoid of nearly every element of classical literature. The fall of Communism has erased nearly every trace of relevance this book may once have had. Its warnings of the evils of totalitarianism were overly alarmist by even Cold War standards and are even more so today. The absence of strong,3-D characters makes even a man vs. society theme seem sorely lacking in depth . The only redeeming quality of this book may lie in providing future readers with an McCarthyist view of the evils of communism from the standpoint of a conservative 50s faux intellectual. If you're looking for a deeper,better-written,and tremendously more entertaining book,try Orwell's Animal Farm. Even walking,\"talking farm animals seem realistic compared to 1984.\"\"\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,             1\n",
